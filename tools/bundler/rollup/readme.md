## rollup.js
The JavaScript module bundler

Compile small pieces of code into something larger and more complex.

### Overview
Rollup is a module bundler for JavaScript which compiles small pieces of code into something larger and more complex, such as a library or application. It uses the new standardized format for code modules included in the ES6 revision of JavaScript, instead of previous idiosyncratic solutions such as CommonJS and AMD. ES modules let you freely and seamlessly combine the most useful individual functions from your favorite libraries. This will eventually be possible natively everywhere, but Rollup lets you do it today.

#### Installation

```shell
npm install --global rollup
```

This will make Rollup available as a global command line tool. You can also install it locally, see [Installing Rollup locally](https://rollupjs.org/tutorial/#installing-rollup-locally).
