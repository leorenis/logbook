## Webpack: Concepts
At its core, webpack is *a static module bundler* for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a [dependency graph](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/dependency-graph/) from one or more entry points and then combines every module your project needs into one or more bundles, which are static assets to serve your content from.

### Tip
To get started you only need to understand its Core Concepts:

- [Entry](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/#entry)
- [Output](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/#output)
- [Loaders](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/#loaders)
- [Plugins](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/#plugins)
- [Mode](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/#mode)
- [Browser Compatibility](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/#browser-compatibility)

This document is intended to give a **high-level** overview of these concepts, while providing links to detailed concept-specific use cases.
