## parceljs
The zero configuration build tool for the web.

Parcel combines a great out-of-the-box development experience with a scalable architecture that can take your project from just getting started to massive production application.

### A build tool for the rest of us.

Parcel starts with a great development experience, from starting a new project, to iterating and debugging, and shipping to production. No more fiddling with configuration, or spending hours to keep up with best practices – it just works!

#### Building a web app with Parcel

```zsh
npm create parcel vanilla my-parcel-app &&
cd my-parcel-app &&
npm start
```

Replace npm with yarn or pnpm to use your preferred package manager. The following templates are supported:

- `vanilla – a` Vanilla JS + HTML app (shown above)
- `react-client – a` TypeScript + React client only app. See [Parcel's React docs](https://parceljs.org/recipes/react/).
- `react-server – a` TypeScript + React Server Components app. See [Parcel's React Server Components docs](https://parceljs.org/recipes/rsc/).
- `react-static – a` TypeScript + React static site generator. [See Parcel's React Server Components docs](https://parceljs.org/recipes/rsc/).
