# Commands

### Setting your email address for every repository on your computer

```
$ git config --global user.email "email@example.com"
```

```
git config --global user.email
email@example.com
```

### Setting your email address for a single repository

Set an email address in Git. You can use any email address.

```
$ git config user.email "email@example.com"
```

Confirm that you have set the email address correctly in Git:

```
$ git config user.email
email@example.com
```

### Edit recent commit messages

To edit the commit message of the most recent commit, you can use the git commit --amend command. This command allows you to modify the commit message without changing the commit's snapshot.
```
git commit --amend
```

### Staging, Unstage and Stash Code

#### Staging

In Git, the term "stage" is often used interchangeably with "add". You can stage files in the terminal using the `git add` command. This command adds new or changed files in your working directory to the Git staging area, allowing you to choose what you are going to commit.

To stage all changes in your repository, you can use `git add .` or `git add -A` to stage all files, including new, modified, and deleted files.

For more granular control, you can use `git add -p` or` git add --patch` to stage parts of files interactively. This command will present you with chunks of changes and prompt you to choose which parts to stage.

#### Unstage

To unstage a specific file, you can use:

```
git restore --staged file-name
```

or 

```
git reset file-name
```

To unstage changes, you can use `git reset` to remove a file from the staging area without changing the working directory.

You can also use `git status` to check the status of your repository and see which files are staged and which are not.

#### Stash

The `git stash` command is used to temporarily save changes in your working directory that are not yet ready to be committed. 
This allows you to switch branches or perform other Git operations without committing changes that are not yet complete.

To apply a stash to your working directory, use the `git stash apply` command. If you want to apply the stash and then remove it from the stash stack, use `git stash pop` instead. I Prefer `git stash pop`. 

If you want to stash specific files or changes, you can use the `git stash push` command with options like `-m` for a message or `-p` to interactively choose which changes to stash.

To delete a specific stash, use the `git stash drop` command followed by the stash identifier. To clear all stashes, use `git stash clear`.

You can also list all stashes in your stash stack using the `git stash list` command.

To view the contents of a stash, you can use the `git stash show` command. By default, it shows the changes in a summary format, but you can use the `-p` flag to see the changes in a patch format, or `-u` to include untracked files.

Since version 2.11, it's pretty easy, you can use the `N` stack number instead of saying "stash@{n}". So now instead of using: `git stash apply "stash@{n}"`

E.g. 
```
git stash apply 1
```

To apply all stashes in Git, you cannot use a single command like `git stash apply all`.

We also cam loop through each stash and apply it one by one. Here is an example of how you might do this in a script:

```
while [ $(git stash list | wc -l) -gt 0 ]; do
  git stash apply
  git stash drop
done

```

*Tip*: To `git stash pop` or `git stash apply`, the working tree MUST be clean. E.g. When git status output: `nothing to commit, working tree clean`.

### Cherry Picking with Git

Sometimes you don't want to merge a whole branch into another, and only need to pick one or two specific commits. This process is called 'cherry picking'.

When should we use Cherry Picking?

When you are working in an project where you are making changes in a branch called `some-features`. You have already made a few commits but want to move just one of them into the master branch.

From `same-features` branch run `git log --oneline` to get a better log of your commits history. Note that the commit hash is what we need to start the cherry picking. For example:

![alt git commands](https://www.previousnext.com.au/sites/default/files/styles/content_1x/public/2019-09/cherry-picking.png?itok=V9GZbHIt)

Checkout the branch where you want to cherry pick the specific commits. In this case master branch:
git checkout master

Now we can cherry pick from `same-features `branch:
`git cherry-pick d467740`

This will cherry pick the commit with hash `d467740` and add it as a new commit on the master branch. Note: it will have a new (and different) commit ID in the master branch.

If you want to cherry pick more than one commit in one go, you can add their commit IDs separated by a space:

```
git cherry-pick d467740 de906d4
```

If the cherry picking gets halted because of conflicts, resolve them and
```
git cherry-pick --continue
```

If you want to bail of this step out altogether, just type:
```
git cherry-pick --abort
```

After all this is done, you can simply push the new commits to the upstream repo (e.g origin) and get on with your day.

Tips n Tricks
In case you needed to cherry pick a merge instead of a commit, you can use:

```
git cherry-pick -m 1 <hash>
```

### Merge vs Rebase

#### Merge
Combines changes from one branch into another by creating a new "merge commit" that represents the integration of the two branches. This preserves the entire history of both branches, showing exactly when and how they were joined.

Examples:

```
git checkout main
git pull origin main

git merge feature/tomerge

git push
```
Or

```
git checkout feature/tomerge
git pull origin main
# solve conficts
git commit -m '[Fix] conflicts'
git pull
git push
```

#### Rebase
Moves the entire branch to begin at the tip of another branch. This rewrites the project history by replaying the commits of the branch on top of the target branch, resulting in a linear history without merge commits.

| Feature        | Merge                                                                 | Rebase                                                                 |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| History        | Preserves the entire history, including branches                      | Rewrites history, creating a linear sequence                          |
| Commit Structure | Creates a merge commit                                                 | No merge commit                                                       |
| Complexity     | Simpler to understand and use                                         | Can be more complex and requires care                                 |
| Safety         | Safer, as it doesn't rewrite history                                  | Potentially dangerous if used improperly                              |
| Use Cases      | Integrating long-lived feature branches, preserving history           | Cleaning up local feature branches, avoiding merge commits            |


Examples:

```
# update a branch main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Rebase a branch feature/rebase na main
git checkout feature/rebase
git rebase main

# Force o push to remote repo (if needed)
git push origin feature/rebase --force

# merge fast-forward (try to apply without commit merge if there is not conflict)
git checkout main
git merge --ff-only feature/rebase

# send changes to remote
git push origin main

```
