# Module Federation
Module Federation is an architectural pattern for the decentralization of JavaScript applications (similar to microservices on the server-side). It allows you to share code and resources among multiple JavaScript applications (or micro-frontends). This can help you:

- Reduce code duplication
- Improve code maintainability
- Lower the overall size of your applications
- Enhance the performance of your applications
