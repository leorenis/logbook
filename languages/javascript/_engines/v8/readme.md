## What is V8?
V8 is Googleâ€™s open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. It is used in Chrome and in Node.js, among others. It implements [ECMAScript](https://tc39.es/ecma262/) and [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/), and runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems that use x64, IA-32, or ARM processors. V8 can be embedded into any C++ application.
