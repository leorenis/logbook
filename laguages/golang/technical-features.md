# Golang technical features

## Variables
- In `Go` if you dont assign a value for a variable, the language set a possible `less` value to take on.
- All variable declared **MUST be used**. `Golang` throws a `Compile-time error`. Sth like this: _variableXXX declared but not used_.
- There isn't a **float** type in `go`. There's a **float32** for numbers until 32 bits and **float64** for numbers until 64 bits.
